# Computational Modelling Social Systems at the University of Konstanz
[David Garcia](http://dgarcia.eu)

Welcome to the online materials for Computational Modelling of Social Systems at the University of Konstanz.
In this course, you will learn how to formulate and analyze computational models of social systems, in particular to study social interaction and the behavior of large groups of people and whole societies. The course integrates content about social dynamics and analytic tools to understand the complex behavior of social systems.

## Who am I?

I am the Professor for Social and Behavioral Data Science at the University of Konstanz. You can find more about my research group 
here: http://dgarcia.eu. My background is Computer Science but I worked my whole career with psychologists, sociologists and physicists 
to learn new ways to understand human behavior. I got my PhD from ETH Zurich in 2012 and a habilitation in 2018, starting to work as 
full professor TU Graz in 2020 and then at the University of Konstanz in 2022. To learn more about my research, check my 
[publications](https://dgarcia.eu/full-publication-list/).

## Course Contents
The course is composed of an initial set of 9 lectures to provide an overview and examples of computational modelling of social systems, followed by 5 interactive sessions in which students present existing work in computational modelling of social systems.

## Suggested articles to present

Up to the ninth lecture, each student needs to choose one paper on computational modelling to present during the second part of the course. Below are some examples but you can propose other articles. No article can be presented twice in the same semester, this will be coordinated during the course. Some paper examples:

## Course grading

Students select a published article from a set of readings to present in the second part and to write a review of the article as final report. The course grade is based on the student presentation (50%), participation in discussions after each presentation (20%), and on the report (30%).
