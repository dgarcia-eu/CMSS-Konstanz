## Complex social behavior example: Polarization
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=650, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/Polarization.jpg")
```

- Two opposing groups can become more extreme due to their perception of the behavior and opinions of the other group. 
- Individuals in isolation do not naturally tend to opinion extremes.
---

## Complex social beavior example: Bank runs
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=600, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/BankRun.jpg")
```
- Banks operate without all the savings in their reserves
- If customers believe that many others withdraw their money, they will do it too
- The rumor and spreading distrust is necessary, customers in isolation would not create a bank run (tragedy of the commons)
---

## Complex social beaviors: Activation and inhibition

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=900, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/Crowd.jpg")
```

- Individuals demonstrating in isolation are peaceful, but in a group a riot can emerge without a clear antecedent
- People alone in the street offer help, but when many are watching they don't act (bystander effect)

# Agent-Based Modelling (ABM)

- Agent-Based Model: A computational analogy of a social system that is composed of a set of agents that represent *discrete* individuals

- Agents have internal states, perceive the actions of other agents, and interact with other agents and their environment (*situated*)

- Agents are *active*: they have a behavioral repertoire, are not just particles

- Agents might have access only to *limited informtion* in their environment

- Agents might have *internal goals* that determine their behavior and can *adapt* to the behavior of other agents or the environment

*Agent-Based Modeling: A New Approach for Theory Building in Social Psychology. Eliot Smith and Frederica Conrey, 2007*

---

# Explaining behavior with ABM

- Observed collective behavior or effects are *explananda*: empirical facts that are missing an explanation.
  - Example: hotter days have higher average crime rates

- ABM offer *explanations*: theories that generate the observed behavior and link it to other empirical facts
  - Example: heat makes people be longer in the street, facilitating crime

- ABM are part of a larger theoretical approach called *Analytical Sociology*, where everything in a model of social behavior must be explicit
  - Example: coding a simulation of people going out depending on temperature and crimes happening outdoors
  
---

# Explaining behavior with ABM

**ABM do not provide empirical evidence**
  - Simulation results alone are not evidence that humans behave in one way or another. Beware of causal conclusions based on ABM alone!

  - They can **generate hypotheses**, for example on the consequences of policies in simulations or formulate predictions

  - They can **reconcile empirical observations** across individual behavior and collective behavior levels

  - They are a way to **analyze theory**, showing necessary or sufficient conditions for some collective behavior to emerge
  
---

## Computational theory instead of exploration

**ABM are for analysis, not just exploration**

- Exploring what happens in a simulation is fine, but ABM can do much more!

- **Behavior calibration** of individual agents with experiments or surveys: integrating social and behavioral findings in an ABM

- **Analysis of observable outcomes** versus parameters of behavior or alternative mechanisms/policies

- **Testing outcomes** with large-scale data (e.g. digital traces from computational social systems), across conditions and over time

*From factors to actors: Computational Sociology and Agent-Based Modeling. Michael Macy and Robert Willer. Annual Review of Sociology, 2002.*

---

# Properties of good ABM

- They **model causation**: agent actions and conditions have counterfactuals and dynamics are not ad hoc to get an outcome


- They have **measureable outcomes:** collective behavior can be aggregated into one or more quantities that can be measured in many simulations and across conditions

- They have **quantifiable designs:** individual dynamics are based on metrics that can be tested with empirical methods (e.g. experiments, surveys)

- Are **minimal and modular:** you can test the sensitivity of outcomes with different blocks of dynamics and include only what is necessary

# The question of attractiveness matching

- Example: Kalick and Hamilton (1986) date choice model

-   Question: do people seek dating mates that are as attractive as possible or matching their own perceived attractiveness?
  
- Conflicting evidence: 
  - In experiments (micro), participants seek to maximize partner attractiveness, participant attractiveness is barely relevant
  - In observational data (macro), attractiveness of couples are   correlated  
  ( $r \sim 0.6$ ) and correlation is stronger for more committed couples

*The matching hypothesis reexamined. Michael Kalick and Thomas Hamilton. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 1986.*
---

# The Kalick and Hamilton dating model

- Start with N male and N female agents, all are uncoupled

- Each agent has a constant attractiveness number randomly sampled between 1 and 10 at the beginning of the simulation

- Repeat while there are uncoupled agents:

  - All male and female agents are randomly paired for a date

  - Dates consist on each individual accepting or rejecting their     partner. Probability of accept is based on a rule taking into account their attractiveness levels (e.g. matching or seeking attractiveness)

  - Dates with both agents accepting form a couple and leave the dating pool



---

# Model metrics

1. Model "time" $t$: Percentage of agents that are in a couple
  - It grows with simulation iterations, starting from $0$ and approaching $100$
  
2. Correlation coefficient between paired couples ( $r_t$ ) at time $t$:
  - $r_t = r(M_t, F_t) = \frac{\sum_{c \in C_t}(m_c - \mu_{M_t})(f_c - \mu_{F_t})}{\sqrt{\sum_{c \in C_t}(m_c - \mu_{M_t})^2(f_c - \mu_{F_t})^2}}$
  - $M_t$ and $F_t$ are the vectors of male and female attractiveness in couples formed up to time $t$, denoted as $C_t$ 

3. Mean attractiveness of the $N_t$ paired couples at time $t$: 
  - $\mu_t = \mu_{M_t} + \mu_{F_t} = \sum_{c \in C_t}  (m_c+f_c) / N_t$

# Seeking similar match: outcomes

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=550, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/matching.png")
```
]
.pull-right[

- Outcomes over simulation time (% matched couples) for the case of seeking similar partners

- Correlation starts very high (0.8)

- No real trend in correlation

- Mean couple attractiveness is around the average the whole simulation


]

# Maximizing partner attractiveness

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=550, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/preference.png")
```
]
.pull-right[

- Outcomes over simulation time (% matched couples) for the case of preferring attractive partners regardless of own attractiveness

- Correlation starts low but raises pretty fast up to about 0.55

- Mean couple attractiveness starts much above average and approaches average

- Attractive agents couple earlier
]

---

# Results of dating model

- **Main result:** attractiveness matching is not necessary for observed correlations, they can be produced by attractiveness seeking alone.

- ABM reconciles apparently conflicting empirical results

- **Comparison with empirical data:** observed empirical correlation is closer to 0.55 than to 0.9
  - This could also be due to measurement error in attractiveness 
  
- **Many simplifications**

# Course assessment

Students select a published article from a set of readings to present in the second part and to
write a *review of the article* as final report. 

The course grade is based on:
- the student presentation (50%)
- participation in discussions after each presentation (20%)
- and on the report (30%)

Coding is not necessary but reimplementing a model from a paper is a great start to present it. This is not a required step: some models might be too complicated or require unavailable data.

The course does not include coding exercises, feel free to use any language.
