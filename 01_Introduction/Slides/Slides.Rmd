## Complex social behavior example: Polarization
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=650, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/Polarization.jpg")
```

- Two opposing groups can become more extreme due to their perception of the behavior and opinions of the other group. 
- Individuals in isolation do not naturally tend to opinion extremes.
---

## Complex social beavior example: Bank runs
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=600, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/BankRun.jpg")
```
- Banks operate without all the savings in their reserves
- If customers believe that many others withdraw their money, they will do it too
- The rumor and spreading distrust is necessary, customers in isolation would not create a bank run (tragedy of the commons)
---

## Complex social beaviors: Activation and inhibition

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=900, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/Crowd.jpg")
```

- Individuals demonstrating in isolation are peaceful, but in a group a riot can emerge without a clear antecedent
- People alone in the street offer help, but when many are watching they don't act (bystander effect)

# Agent-Based Modelling (ABM)

- Agent-Based Model: A computational analogy of a social system that is composed of a set of agents that represent *discrete* individuals

- Agents have internal states, perceive the actions of other agents, and interact with other agents and their environment (*situated*)

- Agents are *active*: they have a behavioral repertoire, are not just particles

- Agents might have access only to *limited information* in their environment

- Agents might have *internal goals* that determine their behavior and can *adapt* to the behavior of other agents or the environment

*Agent-Based Modeling: A New Approach for Theory Building in Social Psychology. Eliot Smith and Frederica Conrey, 2007*

---

# Explaining behavior with ABM

- Observed collective behavior or effects are *explananda*: empirical facts that are missing an explanation.
  - Example: hotter days have higher average crime rates

- ABM offer *explanations*: theories that generate the observed behavior and link it to other empirical facts
  - Example: heat makes people be longer in the street, facilitating crime

- ABM are part of a larger theoretical approach called *Analytical Sociology*, where everything in a model of social behavior must be explicit
  - Example: coding a simulation of people going out depending on temperature and crimes happening outdoors
  
---

# Explaining behavior with ABM

**ABM do not provide empirical evidence**
  - Simulation results alone are not evidence that humans behave in one way or another. Beware of causal conclusions based on ABM alone!

  - They can **generate hypotheses**, for example on the consequences of policies in simulations or formulate predictions

  - They can **reconcile empirical observations** across individual behavior and collective behavior levels

  - They are a way to **analyze theory**, showing necessary or sufficient conditions for some collective behavior to emerge
  
---

## Computational theory instead of exploration

**ABM are for analysis, not just exploration**

- Exploring what happens in a simulation is fine, but ABM can do much more!

- **Behavior calibration** of individual agents with experiments or surveys: integrating social and behavioral findings in an ABM

- **Analysis of observable outcomes** versus parameters of behavior or alternative mechanisms/policies

- **Testing outcomes** with large-scale data (e.g. digital traces from computational social systems), across conditions and over time

*From factors to actors: Computational Sociology and Agent-Based Modeling. Michael Macy and Robert Willer. Annual Review of Sociology, 2002.*

---

# Properties of good ABM

- They **model causation**: agent actions and conditions have counterfactuals and dynamics are not ad hoc to get an outcome


- They have **measureable outcomes:** collective behavior can be aggregated into one or more quantities that can be measured in many simulations and across conditions

- They have **quantifiable designs:** individual dynamics are based on metrics that can be tested with empirical methods (e.g. experiments, surveys)

- Are **minimal and modular:** you can test the sensitivity of outcomes with different blocks of dynamics and include only what is necessary

# The question of attractiveness matching

- Example: Kalick and Hamilton (1986) date choice model

-   Question: do people seek dating mates that are as attractive as possible or matching their own perceived attractiveness?
  
- Conflicting evidence: 
  - In experiments (micro), participants seek to maximize partner attractiveness, participant attractiveness is barely relevant
  - In observational data (macro), attractiveness of couples are   correlated  
  ( $r \sim 0.6$ ) and correlation is stronger for more committed couples

*The matching hypothesis reexamined. Michael Kalick and Thomas Hamilton. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 1986.*
---

# The Kalick and Hamilton dating model

- Start with N male and N female agents, all are uncoupled

- Each agent has a constant attractiveness number randomly sampled between 1 and 10 at the beginning of the simulation

- Repeat while there are uncoupled agents:

  - All male and female agents are randomly paired for a date

  - Dates consist on each individual accepting or rejecting their     partner. Probability of accept is based on a rule taking into account their attractiveness levels (e.g. matching or seeking attractiveness)

  - Dates with both agents accepting form a couple and leave the dating pool



---

# Model metrics

1. Model "time" $t$: Percentage of agents that are in a couple
  - It grows with simulation iterations, starting from $0$ and approaching $100$
  
2. Correlation coefficient between paired couples ( $r_t$ ) at time $t$:
  - $r_t = r(M_t, F_t) = \frac{\sum_{c \in C_t}(m_c - \mu_{M_t})(f_c - \mu_{F_t})}{\sqrt{\sum_{c \in C_t}(m_c - \mu_{M_t})^2(f_c - \mu_{F_t})^2}}$
  - $M_t$ and $F_t$ are the vectors of male and female attractiveness in couples formed up to time $t$, denoted as $C_t$ 

3. Mean attractiveness of the $N_t$ paired couples at time $t$: 
  - $\mu_t = \mu_{M_t} + \mu_{F_t} = \sum_{c \in C_t}  (m_c+f_c) / N_t$

# Seeking similar match: outcomes

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=550, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/matching.png")
```
]
.pull-right[

- Outcomes over simulation time (% matched couples) for the case of seeking similar partners

- Correlation starts very high (0.8)

- No real trend in correlation

- Mean couple attractiveness is around the average the whole simulation


]

# Maximizing partner attractiveness

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=550, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/preference.png")
```
]
.pull-right[

- Outcomes over simulation time (% matched couples) for the case of preferring attractive partners regardless of own attractiveness

- Correlation starts low but raises pretty fast up to about 0.55

- Mean couple attractiveness starts much above average and approaches average

- Attractive agents couple earlier
]

---

# Results of dating model

- **Main result:** attractiveness matching is not necessary for observed correlations, they can be produced by attractiveness seeking alone.

- ABM reconciles apparently conflicting empirical results

- **Comparison with empirical data:** observed empirical correlation is closer to 0.55 than to 0.9
  - This could also be due to measurement error in attractiveness 
  
- **Many simplifications**

# Course assessment

Students select a published article from a set of readings to present in the second part and to
write a *review of the article* as final report. 

The course grade is based on:
- the student presentation (50%)
- participation in discussions after each presentation (20%)
- and on the report (30%)

Presentations and reports should show computational insight, for example by reimplementing the model or a (simplified) version of it. Coding language is up to the choice of the student and code is not reviewed for grading. We recommend python to build on the tutorials.

Deadline for final reports: September 1st, 2025

# Articles for student presentations
- Check https://github.com/dgarcia-eu/CMSS-Konstanz for article suggestions
- You can find your own paper too. Choose by email to me by 10.06
- No paper can be presented by two students: First-come first-served
- Your presentation date will be chosen at random and announced once registrations are final. Date swaps are allowed by agreement of both students.

# Grading criteria
- **Insight into the motivation for the model.** What question does it claim to answer? Are there gaps in motivation? Can it be updated if the paper is old?
- **Understanding model formalization.** Explain the description of the model including equations and assumptions. Add a critical reflection on any implicit assumptions or dynamics that have not been documented or adequately explained.
- **Computational insight into the model.** Implement and run simulations of the model to a reasonable extent. Comparison of results with the paper. Share your code and insights on Github for extra points.
- **Broader context.** Reference to other models seen in the lectures, both by the lecturer and by other students: which have similar aims? Which have similar dynamics, principles, or behaviors?
- **Critical reflection** on plausibility, evidence, and insights of the model based on what we have seen in the lectures
