&lt;/div&gt;

&gt; **Social Resilience:** The ability of a community to withstand external stresses, disturbances, and environmental changes

Nauru as an example of lack of resilience:

- Environmental shock in phosphate mining
- Loss of population and employment

What makes a society lose less or even gain from adversity?

# Modelling social resilience online

Social resilience can be modelled as a process of how users stay active or inactive in a social networking site. 

If we consider social network users as rational, they will respond to incentives to stay active or to abandon social networks depending on **benefits and costs**.

**Benefits** can be quantified through the content users receive from their friends (shares, comments) and through the attention and support given by their friends (likes, votes).

A simple way to model monotonic benefits is proportionally to the active friends of a user `\(k_u\)`:

`$$benefit_u = b * k_u$$`

# Costs of using an online social network

&lt;div style="float:right"&gt;
&lt;img src="Figures/user3.jpg" alt="table flip." width=300pt/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
**Costs:** Using social network is not only benefits, there are also costs associated with being active, for example:  

- Time spent to learn to use the interface of the platform  
- Risks of disclosing personal information  
- Opportunity costs: you could be doing something else  
- Economic costs, for example membership fees.

A common assumption about costs is that they are relatively similar for all users, thus modeling them as a constant `\(c\)`. Then, a user will become inactive when the total benefits are below the cost:

$$ b *k_u &lt; c $$

# The k-core decomposition

The graph remaining after the cascade above is what is called a k-core

&gt; **k-core**: A k-core of a graph `\(G\)` is a maximal connected subgraph of `\(G\)` in which all vertices have degree at least k.

For any network, you can calculate its k-core decomposition as follows:  

- Start with `\(k_s=1\)`  
- Remove all nodes with degree less than or equal to `\(k_s\)` and their links  
- Repeat until all nodes have degree larger than `\(k_s\)`  
- Increase `\(k_s\)` by one and repeat until no nodes are left

The nodes and the edges removed for certain of `\(k_s=k\)` is called the **k-shell**.  
A **k-core** is the set of all k-shells with `\(k_s \geq k\)`.

---

# Coreness centrality

.center[![:scale 27%](Figures/kcore_total.png)![:scale 72%](Figures/kcore_shells.png)]

The k-shell number of a node is also called **coreness centrality**.


Figure from [Kitsak et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys1746) Next session we will learn more about that work and how coreness is linked to spreading.
---

# Coreness and social resilience

The cost to benefit ratio `\(c/b\)` defines a critical value of the degree `\(K\)`, below which users with degree `\(k_u&lt;K\)` will leave the social network. The remaining active social network is the k-core corresponding to `\(K\)`. The cumulative function of coreness values in the network serves as a **resilience function**:

.center[![](Figures/resilience.png)]

# Generalizing social resilience

.pull-left[
- The benefit function of a user can be more complex, for example as a calculation based on several properties of the user's social neighborhood.
- Yu et al. improved the model by adding a fraction `\(q\)` of necessary friends to stay active as a condition. This models opportunity costs and alternatives. 
- Example: cascade when `\(k_s=3\)` and `\(q=5\)`

# Backtesting with Friendster's collapse

Constantly decreasing `\(k_s\)` in simple k-core model. Inset: fraction of nodes with coreness below the median over the lifetime of Friendster.

# A better fit to Friendster's collapse
.center[![:scale 80%](Figures/FriendsterPred2.png)]

- Running KQ cascades in which nodes do not always leave, they do so with probablity `\(f=0.15\)`
- Fit of KQ cascade with `\(k_s =20\)`, `\(q= 0.2\)`
- Similar model complexity but much more plausible model: 
  - need of `\(q\)` and stochastic decision instead of worsening conditions

# Stretching the Google trends method

Data scientists at Facebook [replied to the Arxiv paper](https://www.facebook.com/notes/mike-develin/debunking-princeton/10151947421191849/) showing the problem with measuring social network use levels using Google Trends data. Applying the same methodology, Facebook researchers reached the conclusion that Princeton would lose 80% of its students by 2021:

# Stretching the Google trends method

You can even apply it to air and come to the conclusion that the atmosphere will run out of air by 2060:

# Google trends for Facebook

The Facebook examples show that decrease in search volume is a decrease in information searching about the social network, not a decrease in access and use.

![](Figures/FacebookGT.png)


---

# Google trends for Twitter

Twitter is not living a second growth, in fact it's growth has been rather slow to stagnant for a few years, even though it appears it is gaining users after Trump's permanent suspension.

![](Figures/TwittterGT.png)

# Temporal validity issues

&lt;/br&gt;
A more accurate way to measure activity in a social network is Bruno Ribeiro's [approach using Alexa data](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2566486.2567984), but Alexa focuses on website visits without considering access through mobile apps. 


&lt;/br&gt;
Measurement is always an important issue in Computational Social Systems, and just because a paper used a measurement method few years ago, it does not mean it is valid today.

&lt;/br&gt;
&gt; **Take home message:** Your measures based on today's digital traces might not work on tomorrow's

# Summary

- The question of social resilience
  - Why do societies collapse?
  - Online social networks as the prime example of collapse


- Modelling social resilience as networked decisions
  - Modeling human decisions rather than disease spreading
  - A decision of a user leaving affects the situation of other users
  - This can be mapped to network metrics like coreness centrality


- Empirical analysis of online social resilience
  - Using trends as activity and sometimes social network data
  - Friendster collapse is better fitted by KQ model
  - Limits of google trends: the Facebook case
